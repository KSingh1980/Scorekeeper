# Welcome!

This is a test application I made based on http://courses.knowthen.com/courses/elm-for-beginners to practice elm. 

The example is a web component that allows you to add users and track their scores as well as to display the latest plays and delete them if created in error.

It was an enjoyable opportunity to practice Elm.

To run, clone this repo, in the directory: 

```npm install``` 

and 

``` gulp ```

to run on port 4000.
